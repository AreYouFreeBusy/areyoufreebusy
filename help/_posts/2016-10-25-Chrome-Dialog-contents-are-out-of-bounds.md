Some of you might be facing this issue when clicking on the **FreeBusy** widget on chrome, that causes the contents of the popup for an extension (triggered by the button in the toolbar) to extend beyond the popup itself like below:

To fix this

 1. Open up the **Chrome** browser
 2. In the address bar type `chrome://extensions` and press ENTER
 3. Find the **FreeBusy Scheduling Assistant** extension
 4. Click on **options** *Dont worry that the screen reads coming soon*
 5. Press CTRL and +/- (or scroll wheel) and get the page zoom to 100%
