### **Notifications**

### Default notifications for Scheduling

The default behaviour for scheduling notifications depends on your **Meeting Proposals** setting on the [Share](https://freebusy.io/share) page.

#### **"Notify" mode**
You will receive an email notification with the proposal, which you can accept or ignore. 

#### **"Notify and Accept" mode**
You will receive an email notification informing you that the meeting proposal has been automatically accepted and added to your calendar.
