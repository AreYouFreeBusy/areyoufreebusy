Tick the **Guarded** option and press **Save**.
FreeBusy will now show you unavailable during the times you've shared.

To share a specific time with your audience, go to your calendar and create a new event.
When doing so,

- change the event type from **Busy** to **Available** (or **Free**), and
- leave the subject blank.

<br>
FreeBusy will understand that this is a specific time that you'd like to be marked available.
Your audience will be able to request a meeting with you during this time.
