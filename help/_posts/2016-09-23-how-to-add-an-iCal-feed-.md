##Adding an iCal feed

 1. Subscribe to the **iCal** **feed** from your **Office 365** calendar in your account *(you can use Outlook Web App or desktop Outlook to do that)*.
 2. Go to you [FreeBusy Account](https://freebusy.io/account) and refresh the page. That will cause FreeBusy to re-query your Office 365 account for new calendars that might have been added. 
 3. You'll see the iCal feed appear as a calendar. Make sure it's checked.
