## Check When Contacts Are Available

Ask for people in your contacts list by their first name to find out when they are free or busy for a phone call or meeting (if they share availability with you).

 - Alexa, ask FreeBusy to check if Jeremy is free on Wednesday.
 - Alexa, open FreeBusy and see if Kristen is busy tomorrow.
