### Get availability for only some of my calendars

Suppose you linked a Google Calendar which has two subcalendars, titled "Office" and "Outcall".
You'd like FreeBusy to ignore all events in the "Outcall" subcalendar when calculating availability.

To do so, select **Calendars & Integrations** from the top right menu.

In a section titled **Calendars and Contacts**, find the calendar you wish to manage.
Uncheck the subcalendars that you want FreeBusy to ignore and click **Save**.
