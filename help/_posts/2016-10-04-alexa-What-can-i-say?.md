## Check When Contacts Are Available 

Ask for people in your contacts list by their first name to find out when they are free or busy for a phone call or meeting   (if they share availability with you). 


 - "Alexa, open FreeBusy and see if Kristen is busy tomorrow." 
 - "Alexa, ask FreeBusy to check if Jeremy is free on Wednesday." 


## Check Your Own Calendar 
 
 - "Alexa, ask FreeBusy what's my schedule for Wednesday."  
 - "Alexa, ask FreeBusy what's my next meeting."

 
## Schedule Events, Meetings, Phone Calls 

Now that you know when everyone is available, get it scheduled, handsfree! FreeBusy Scheduling Buddy will put it on your calendar. 

 - "Alexa, ask FreeBusy to create an event for Monday" 
 - "Alexa, ask FreeBusy to schedule a phone call for September 6th" 
 - "Alexa, open FreeBusy and set up a meeting for tomorrow"
