<br>
Once on the **New Group** page, begin by selecting a name for the group.
Also decide on the **Vanity URL** the group will be accessible with.

> **Note**
> Once the group is created, the **Vanity URL** cannot be changed.

<br>
In the section titled **Members**, provide the email addresses of all group members.

> **Note**
> Once the group is created, any member can add others but can only remove themselves.

<br>
Finally, in the section **Availability Logic** indicate whether everyone is required (**All Members Required**), or if only one group member is sufficient to book a meeting (**At Least One Member Required**).
