### How do I read team availability?


The [Meet](https://freebusy.io/meet) page shows you availability for all participants on a grid.

In the example above, most of the timeslots are **unavailable**.
You can tell a timeslot is **unavailable** when it's **blank**. It will also say "*unavailable*" on hover.

There are two **available** timeslots.
You can tell a timeslot is **available** when it shows a tick. Its label will tell you how many participants are available.
At 11 a.m., only *2 out of 3* participants are available. **Everyone is available at 11.30 a.m.**

When you hover over an **available** timeslot, you can explore which participants are unavailable.

Notice that at 11 a.m., **Tim** is not available for a meeting.
If it's important that everyone be present, 11.30 a.m. is clearly the better choice.

**Click** on a timeslot to select it.
