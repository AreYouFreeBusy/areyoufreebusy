> **Note**

> If none of the dates are available, check your settings on the [Share](https://freebusy.io/share) page.
> In particular ensure that at least one day of week is shared.
> If you're in the **Guarded** availability mode, you must have events marked **Free** on your calendar to be shown as available.

The timeslot view will show *all* timeslots within your shared time range.

> Only you, as the calendar owner, can see the unavailable timeslots.
