Ensure you're signed in.
Navigate to your FreeBusy page, selecting a duration and a date.
> **Note**
> If none of the dates are available, check your settings on the [Share](https://freebusy.io/share) page.
> In particular ensure that at least one day of week is shared.
> If you're in the **Guarded** availability mode, you must have events marked **Free** on your calendar to be shown as available.

<br>
The timeslot view will show *all* timeslots within your shared time range.
> **Note**
> Only you, as the calendar owner, can see the unavailable timeslots.

<br>
Find the time that you want to troubleshoot.
**Click** on the dropdown button.

The dropdown pane tells you why **FreeBusy** marks you **unavailable**.
> **Note**
> Only you, as the calendar owner, can see the dropdown pane.

<br>
In this case, there was another event scheduled at 10 a.m.
