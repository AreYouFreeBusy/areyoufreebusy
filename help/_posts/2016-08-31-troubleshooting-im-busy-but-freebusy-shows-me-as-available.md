### I'm busy but FreeBusy shows me as available

First, try the following:

- Check that your calendar is linked to FreeBusy on the [Account](https://freebusy.io/account) page.
- Ensure the event is marked **Busy** in your calendar.

If you've confirmed the above, sign out and back in with that calendar.
You should now appear **Busy** during the time of the event.
