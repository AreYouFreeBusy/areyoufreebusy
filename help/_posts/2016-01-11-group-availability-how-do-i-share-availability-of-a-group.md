> **Note**

> Once the group is created, any member can add others but can only remove themselves.

<br><br>
Finally, in the section **Availability Logic** indicate whether everyone is required (**All Members Required**), or if only one group member is sufficient to book a meeting (**At Least One Member Required**).
