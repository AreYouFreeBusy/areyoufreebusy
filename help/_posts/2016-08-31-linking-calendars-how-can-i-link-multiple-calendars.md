To link multiple calendars to FreeBusy, [sign in with one of the calendars](https://freebusy.io/connect).

Once done, select **Link Another Calendar** from the top right menu.

This will take your through the same steps as when you signed in with the first calendar.

Every time you sign in with another calendar, FreeBusy will link them together.
You can see which calendars you've already linked on your [Account](https://freebusy.io/account) page.
