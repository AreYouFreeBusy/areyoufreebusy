                            	<ul>

							<li>	Decreased time needed for scheduling interviews <br> </li>
							<li>	Gets the optimal 1:1 meeting's time with candidate's intreseted in the job <br> </li>
							<li>	Saves a lot of energy needed for manual work <br> </li>
				</ul>

								Juggling different candidates for different job roles will get confusing and will often lead to double booking yourself. Getting 40 meeting invites for 1 job role with different times & dates is going to do your head in, trying to manage your time throughout the week.
                                <br><br>
								Brian’s job was to find the best talent available for his clients in which he had to schedule a lot of interviews on their behalf as well as his personal meetings and appointments.
                                <br><br>
								<b>FreeBusy</b> really helped Brian and came in handy with an important tool: having the blocked time sync on a single view which was extremely helpful for a person in Brian's line of work.
                                <br><br>
								Instead of going through his separate email accounts to see his availability on other platforms, he gets to see his availability from one screen and gets back to the candidate ASAP, keeping the candidate keen for the job.
                                <br><br>
								Lastly, the ability to access his Calendar offline via synchronizing it to his iPhone saved him so much time & energy by not having to access his calendar’s online.

							"I run a consulting practice where my clients often want me to be on their own company email systems. This means that I'm often juggling multiple calendars, which proves to be a nightmare when trying to determine if I'm available at a given time and have to check each client's calendar separately--along with my own company and personal calendars. FreeBusy took that pain away; I now have one place to look to know when I'm free (or busy). Thank you!"                            </p>
